Design and implement an Online Shopping System in Java that demonstrates Functions/Methods, Arrays and Strings, Classes and Objects, Constructors, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

Detailed Requirements
1. Classes and Objects

Create the following classes:

------User (base class)
------Customer (inherits from User)
-------Admin (inherits from User)
-------Product (represents items for sale)
Order (represents a customer’s purchase)

2. Constructors

------Implement default and parameterized constructors in all classes.
-------Demonstrate constructor chaining in subclasses.

3. Encapsulation

-------All attributes should be private.
-------Provide getter and setter methods with validation (e.g., price > 0, quantity ≥ 0).
--------Prevent direct modification of sensitive data like orderId.

4. Arrays and Strings

-------Store multiple products in an array inside Admin.
Implement a method to search for a product by name (String comparison).
Sort products by price using a custom sorting algorithm.
--------Display product names in uppercase using String operations.

5. Functions / Methods

Create methods:

--------addProduct(Product p) in Admin
placeOrder(Customer c, Product[] products) in Order
calculateTotal() in Order


Use method overloading for addProduct() (one version accepts a single product, another accepts an array of products).

6. Inheritance

-------Customer and Admin inherit from User.
-------Common attributes: name, email.
-------Additional attributes for Customer: address.
-------Additional attributes for Admin: role.

7. Polymorphism

Create a method displayRole() in User and override it in Customer and Admin.
Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using base class references.

8. Additional Features

Validate input (e.g., quantity cannot be negative).
Display the most expensive product in the catalog.
Use String operations for formatting output.
